# Test Summary Report for swc-macro Branch

## Overview
Comprehensive test results for the rspack swc-macro branch after running all unit tests and integration tests.

## Test Results Summary

### 1. Unit Tests (`pnpm test:unit`)
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Components tested**:
  - rspack-cli tests: PASSED (multiple test suites)
  - rspack-test-tools tests: FAILED due to snapshot issues

### 2. Webpack Compatibility Tests (`pnpm test:webpack`)
- **Status**: FAILED with multiple issues
- **Key Failures**:
  - **MultiCompiler.test.js**: 2 test failures due to timeout (2000ms)
    - "should respect parallelism when using invalidate"
    - "should respect dependencies when using invalidate"
  - **TestCasesHot.test.js**: Test suite failed to run
    - Jest worker process terminated with SIGSEGV (segmentation fault)
  - **StatsTestCases.basictest.js**: Failed test for "dynamic-import"

### 3. Hot Module Replacement Tests (`pnpm test:hot`)
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Test Suites**: 1 failed, 1 total
- **Tests**: 1 failed, 3 skipped, 74 passed, 78 total
- **Snapshots**: 1 failed, 1 total
- **Issue**: Snapshot mismatch in dynamic import tests

### 4. Diff Tests (`pnpm test:diff`)
- **Status**: FAILED
- **Test Suites**: 1 failed, 1 total
- **Tests**: 14 failed, 487 passed, 501 total
- **Failure Rate**: 2.8% (14/501)

### 5. E2E Tests (`pnpm test:e2e`)
- **Status**: Could not run
- **Issue**: Playwright not installed (requires `pnpm exec playwright install`)

### 6. Module Federation & Tree-shaking Tests
- **Manual Testing**: PASSED
- Successfully verified tree-shaking functionality works correctly
- Module federation tests passed when run individually

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Snapshot test failure indicates potential changes in HMR output
- May need to update snapshots with `npm run test:hot -- -u`

### 2. MultiCompiler Timeout Issues
- Two tests consistently timeout after 2000ms
- May indicate performance regression or race conditions in the swc-macro implementation

### 3. Segmentation Fault
- Critical issue: Jest worker process crashed with SIGSEGV
- Indicates potential memory corruption or native code issues
- Requires investigation in the Rust/native binding layer

### 4. Stats Output Changes
- Dynamic import stats test failing
- May indicate changes in how stats are generated with the swc-macro implementation

## Working Features

Despite the test failures, the following functionality was verified to be working:
- Basic compilation and bundling
- Tree-shaking for unused exports
- Module federation shared module support
- CommonJS and ESM export handling (with noted limitations)

## Known Limitations

1. **Object.defineProperty**: Tree-shaking macros are temporarily disabled for Object.defineProperty patterns to avoid syntax errors with swc-generated code (documented in `common_js_exports_dependency.rs` line 263)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate and fix the segmentation fault issue
   - Address MultiCompiler timeout issues
   - Update HMR snapshots if the changes are expected

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Profile the MultiCompiler tests to understand timeout causes
   - Debug the native binding crash in TestCasesHot
   - Review stats generation changes for dynamic imports

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Run tests with `--runInBand` to avoid concurrency issues
   - Use smaller test subsets to isolate failing tests
   - Enable debug logging for native binding issues

## Test Results Overview

| Test Suite | Status | Pass Rate | Critical Issues |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Unit Tests | ❌ FAILED | ~95% | Snapshot failures |
| Webpack Tests | ❌ FAILED | Partial | SIGSEGV, timeouts |
| Hot Tests | ❌ FAILED | 74/78 (94.9%) | Snapshot mismatch |
| Diff Tests | ❌ FAILED | 487/501 (97.2%) | 14 test failures |
| E2E Tests | ⚠️ N/A | - | Playwright not installed |

## Conclusion

The swc-macro branch has successfully implemented tree-shaking macro support for shared modules, with core functionality working as expected. However, there are several test failures that need to be addressed:

1. **Most Critical**: Segmentation fault in webpack tests indicates potential memory safety issues
2. **High Priority**: MultiCompiler timeout issues affecting parallel compilation
3. **Medium Priority**: Snapshot mismatches in hot and diff tests (14 failures out of 501)
4. **Low Priority**: E2E tests setup (Playwright installation)

Despite these issues, the branch demonstrates:
- ✅ Working tree-shaking for unused exports
- ✅ Module federation shared module support
- ✅ ~97% pass rate in diff tests
- ✅ Core compilation and bundling functionality

The branch requires stabilization work, particularly addressing the segmentation fault and timeout issues, before it can be considered production-ready.
